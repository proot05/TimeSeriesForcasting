# Conceptual Design: 3D Point Cloud Enhancement for On-the-Fly 3D Printer Control

## Description
To 3D print on a dynamic surface, a six-axis robotic arm utilizes a high frequency depth and color camera to create an RGBD 3D point cloud of the surface to be printed on. This allows the printer to observe the shape change of the surface for a period of time and use that data to predict the shape of the surface at the time of the next point it needs to print using a RNN algorithm. However, this workflow faces some challenges due to the variation in quality of the 3D point clouds produced by the camera. As the camera is high frequency, it is inherently low resolution. Additionally, the camera produces point clouds that are particularly noisy in the vertical direction and the camera is incapable of filling in all differently colored areas of the surface given specific lighting and exposure settings. Therefore, in order to perform more precise control of the printer a pipeline for denoising, completing, and upsampling 3D point clouds will be created in this project. Most of the datasets and ideas explored here to carry out these tasks come from this review article.
